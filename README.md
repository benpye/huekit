  Automatically bridge third party hue lights to HomeKit.
  <br><br>
  Since philips hue does not enable HomeKit for third party ZigBee devices, this project aims to close the gap.
  It automatically detects, whether a light is an original device or a third party device and then bridges it
  to HomeKit.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Golang (>=1.14.3)
- Make


## üîß Usage/Installation

- Download the released package for your operating system or follow the build instructions
- Retrieve the ip address of the bridge in the hue app (Settings > Hue Bridges > i near the [Bridge Name])
- Place the config.yml, that is contained in the release package or from [./configs/config.yml](./configs/config.yml), near the retrieved binary.
- Open the config.yml and insert the ip address in the `''` behind the `bridge_address` key
- Run `./huekit`
- Check, if it says, that you need to press the link button. If so, press the button to authenticate huekit at your hue bridge
- Open the Home app on your apple device and click on the top right `+` icon to add an accessory.
- Tap on "I Don't Have A Code or Cannot Scan"
- Select `HueKit` and insert the code from the `config.yml`, that is configured after the `homekit_pin` key


**Hint** In order to reset the huekit, remove the `huekit_data` directory near the binary.


## üèó Build

In order to build the binary, just run `make build`. The binary will be placed in the `./bin` directory.
